# Predicting Football Match Outcomes with Explainable Machine Learning

This repository reproduces the experiments from  
**‚ÄúPredicting Football Match Outcomes with Explainable Machine Learning:  
A Data- & Knowledge-Driven Framework, Risk-Aware Staking, and League-Scale Evaluation.‚Äù**

---

## üîç Overview
- **Goal:** Predict Win/Draw/Loss (W/D/W) for Premier League 2020/21 fixtures.  
- **Approach:** Knowledge-driven feature engineering + calibrated tree models.  
- **Core models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost.  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Macro-F1, Log-Loss, Brier Score, Ranked Probability Score.  
- **Explainability:** SHAP/permutation importances for global + local interpretation.  
- **Risk-aware staking:** Kelly-based position sizing on calibrated probabilities.
